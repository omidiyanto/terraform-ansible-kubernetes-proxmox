Welcome to the **Kubernetes Cluster Automation on Proxmox VE with Terraform and Ansible** project! This repository is designed to help you effortlessly set up a robust Kubernetes (K8s) cluster using **Terraform** and **Ansible**. If you're looking to streamline your K8s deployment process on Proxmox Virtual Environment, you‚Äôre in the right place!

## üìñ Project Overview
<img src=https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbe22844-e705-4e43-ad32-2540c02dcbd7>
In this project, you will find a comprehensive solution for automating the creation of a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster that consists of one master node and two worker nodes. By leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and configuration management tools, you can set up a scalable environment for deploying your containerized applications with minimal effort.

### üöÄ Key Features

- **Terraform**: Utilize Terraform for provisioning and managing the Proxmox virtual machines, enabling consistent and repeatable deployments.
- **Ansible**: Use Ansible playbooks to automate the installation and configuration of Kubernetes components, ensuring a smooth and efficient setup process.
- **Kubernetes**: Deploy a fully functional K8s cluster, complete with one master and two worker nodes, ready for your containerized applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Terraform**: As Infrastructure as Code tool to provisioning servers.
- **Ansible**: For automating configuration management and installation.
- **Kubernetes**: The leading platform for container orchestration.
- **Proxmox VE**: An open-source server virtualization management platform.

## üì¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following set up:

- A running **Proxmox VE** environment.
- **Terraform** and **Ansible** installed on proxmox machine.
- Pre-configured VM Template with cloud-init.
