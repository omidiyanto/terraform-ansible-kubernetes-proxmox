In this project, you will find a comprehensive solution for automating the creation of a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster that consists of one master node and two worker nodes. By leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and configuration management tools, you can set up a scalable environment for deploying your containerized applications with minimal effort.

### 🚀 Key Features

- **Terraform**: Utilize Terraform for provisioning and managing the Proxmox virtual machines, enabling consistent and repeatable deployments.
- **Ansible**: Use Ansible playbooks to automate the installation and configuration of Kubernetes components, ensuring a smooth and efficient setup process.
- **Kubernetes**: Deploy a fully functional K8s cluster, complete with one master and two worker nodes, ready for your containerized applications.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Terraform**: As Infrastructure as Code tool to provisioning servers.
- **Ansible**: For automating configuration management and installation.
- **Kubernetes**: The leading platform for container orchestration.
- **Proxmox VE**: An open-source server virtualization management platform.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
